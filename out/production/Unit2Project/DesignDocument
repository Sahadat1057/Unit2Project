LinearEquation class

Instance variables:
    private int x1- this variable represents the x variable in the first coordinate
    private int y1- this variable represents the y variable in the first coordinate
    private int x2- this variable represents the x value in the second coordinate
    private int y2- this variable represents the y value in the second coordinate



Constructors:
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) slope method


Methods:
    public int difference(int x, int y) difference method
    This method will find the difference between y and x

    public double slope(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) slope method
    This method will call the difference method parameters to find out the slope

    public double findY-Intercept(double x1, double y1)
    This method will use one of the previous points to find out the y intercept

    public double distanceFormula(int x1, int y1, int x1, int y2)
    This method will use the same parameters as the slope method and LinearEquation calculator to find the distance betweeen the two points

    math.round()
    This method will be used to round certain values

    public String toString()
    This method will display all relevant information about this
    instance including:
    - X and Y coordinate information
    - Slope Intercept Form equation (includes y intercept)
    - Distance between both coordinates

Steps:

    Step 1: Ask user to enter x value of coordinate 1 (x1)
    Step 2: Ask user to enter y value of coordinate 2 (y1)
    Step 3: Ask user to enter x value of coordinate 2 (x2)
    Step 4: Ask user to enter y value of coordinate 2 (y2)
    Step 5: Create object, LinearEquation, which has 4 parameters
    Step 6: Calculate Slope using a method which has 4 parameters, by calling it within the object LinearEquation
    Step 7: Use calculateY-Intercept method which takes in 2 parameters (x and y), by calling it within the object, LinearEquation, and leaving the last 2 parameters blank
    Step 8: Use distanceFormula method which takes in 4 parameters, by calling it within the object LinearEquation
    Step 9: Use method to String to display all this info
