LinearEquation class

Instance variables:
    private int x1- this variable represents the x variable in the first coordinate, for slope
    private int y1- this variable represents the y variable in the first coordinate, for slope
    private int x2- this variable represents the x value in the second coordinate, for slope
    private int y2- this variable represents the y value in the second coordinate

Objects:


Constructors:
public LinearEquation(slope(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) slope method

Methods:
    public int difference(int x, int y) difference method
    public double slope(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) slope method

Steps:

    Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point(x1)
    Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point(y1)
    Step 3: Ask user to enter third coordinate point(x2)
    Step 4: Ask user to enter fourth coordinate point(y2)
    Step 5: Calculate Slope using a method which has 4 parameters, it takes the difference of the y and x values and divides y over x
    Step 6: Use calculateY-Intercept method which takes in 2 parameters (x and y), this method will find out the y intercept because if you have y and x plus the slope you can calculate the y intercept
    Step 7: Use a constructor to call
