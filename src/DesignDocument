LinearEquation class

Instance variables:
    private int x1- this variable represents the x variable in the first coordinate
    private int y1- this variable represents the y variable in the first coordinate
    private int x2- this variable represents the x value in the second coordinate
    private int y2- this variable represents the y value in the second coordinate
    private int xDifference- this variable represents the difference between x2 and x1, used to show the slope intercept form in fraction form
    private int yDifference- this variable represents the difference between y2 and y1, used to show the slope intercept form in fraction form



Constructors:
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
    This constructor will set the instance variables into the specific parameters


Methods:

    public double slope() method
    This method will use the instance variables x1, x2, y1, y2 to calculate the slope

    public double roundedSlope() method;
    This method will return the rounded slope value to the nearest hundredth

    public double findYIntercept()
    This method will use the instance variables x1 and y1 to calculate the value of the y intercept

    public double roundedYIntercept()
    This method will return the rounded Y Intercept value to the nearest hundredth

    public String slopeInterceptForm()
    This method will use the instance variables xDifference and yDifference and calling the findYIntercept method to showcase the slope intercept equation in fraction form

    public double findDistance()
    This method will use the instance variables xDifference and yDifference and the math.pow, math.sqrt functions to find the distance which will then be rounded to the nearest hundredth

    math.pow()
    This method will be used to square the xDifference and yDifference values in order for the distance formula to work

    math.sqrt()
    This method will be used to do the square root expression in order for the distance formula to work

    math.round()
    This method will be used to round the slope value , y intercept value, distance value, and y value to the hundredth place

    public String findCoordinatePoint()
    This method will be used to calculate the y value given the x value based on the slope intercept equation

    public String toString()
    This method will display all relevant information about this
    instance including:
    - X and Y coordinate information
    - Slope of line info (slope method)
    - Slope Intercept Form equation (includes y intercept) (slopeInterceptForm)
    - Distance between both coordinates (findDistance)




EquationRunner.java

Steps:

    Step 1: Ask user to enter the first coordinate (x1,y1)
    Step 2: Ask user to enter the second coordinate (x2,y2)
    Step 3: Use parse method to find where the x and y values are
    Step 4: Create new object called slopeEquation, which has 4 parameters done by using the LinearEquation constructor
    Step 5: Use method toString display slope of line, slope intercept form, and distance info
    Step 6: Ask user to enter x value
    Step 7: Use a method to print out the solved coordinate point
