LinearEquation class

Instance variables:
    private int x1- this variable represents the x variable in the first coordinate
    private int y1- this variable represents the y variable in the first coordinate
    private int x2- this variable represents the x value in the second coordinate
    private int y2- this variable represents the y value in the second coordinate
    private int xDifference- this variable represents the difference between x2 and x1, used to show the slope intercept form in fraction form
    private int yDifference- this variable represents the difference between y2 and y1, used to show the slope intercept form in fraction form



Constructors:
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)


Methods:

    public double slope() slope method
    This method will use the instance variables x1, x2, y1, y2 to calculate the slope

    public double findYIntercept()
    This method will use the instance variables x1 and y1 to calculate the value of the y intercept

    public String slopeInterceptForm()
    This method will use the instance variables xDifference and yDifference and calling the findYIntercept method to showcase the slope intercept equation in fraction form

    public double findDistance()
    This method will use the instance variables xDifference and yDifference and the

    math.pow()
    This method will be used to square the xDifference and yDifference values in order for the distance formula to work

    math.sqrt()
    This method will be used to do the square root expression in order for the distance formula to work

    math.round()
    This method will be used to round the slope value , distance value, and y value to the hundredth place

    public String findCoordinatePoint()
    This method will be used to calculate the y value given the x value based on the slope intercept equation

    public String toString()
    This method will display all relevant information about this
    instance including:
    - X and Y coordinate information
    - Slope Intercept Form equation (includes y intercept)
    - Distance between both coordinates

Steps:

    Step 1: Ask user to enter x value of coordinate 1 (x1)
    Step 2: Ask user to enter y value of coordinate 2 (y1)
    Step 3: Ask user to enter x value of coordinate 2 (x2)
    Step 4: Ask user to enter y value of coordinate 2 (y2)
    Step 5: Create object, LinearEquation, which has 4 parameters
    Step 6: Calculate Slope using a method which has 4 parameters, by calling it within the object LinearEquation
    Step 7: Use calculateY-Intercept method which takes in 2 parameters (x and y), by calling it within the object, LinearEquation, and leaving the last 2 parameters blank
    Step 8: Use distanceFormula method which takes in 4 parameters, by calling it within the object LinearEquation
    Step 9: Use method to String to display all this info
